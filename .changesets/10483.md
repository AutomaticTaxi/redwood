- fix(setup): Updates GraphQL Fragments Setup to properly prettify web app after configuring possibleTypes (#10483) by @dthyresson

In 7, the prettier package was updated such that the format function is asynchronous and now needs to use await.

```ts
  const prettifiedApp = await format(source, {
    ...prettierOptions,
    parser: 'babel-ts',
  })
```
